1.  **Initialize Git:** `git init`
2.  **Add Files:** `git add .`
3.  **Check Status:** `git status` 
    * *Make sure `.env` is **not** listed in the "Changes to be committed".*
4.  **Commit:** `git commit -m "Initial commit: Blog CMS ready"`
5.  **Push:** Create your repo on GitHub and follow their "push an existing repository" instructions.
