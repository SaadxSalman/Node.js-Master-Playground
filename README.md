# 🚀 Node.js Master Playground

Welcome to the **Node.js Master Playground**! This repository is a curated, project-driven learning environment designed to take you from the basics of JavaScript on the server to mastering complex, scalable backend architectures. Instead of just reading theory, you will learn by building, breaking, and fixing real-world applications..

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to **demystify Node.js**. We break down complex concepts—like the Event Loop, Asynchronous programming, and Stream processing—into digestible, hands-on modules. Whether you are a beginner or looking to polish your senior-level skills, this playground has something for you.

## 🛠️ Core Concepts Covered

This repository dives deep into the following areas:

* **The Fundamentals:** Global objects, Module systems (CommonJS vs ES6), and NPM.
* **Asynchronous Mastery:** Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await.
* **Node.js Internals:** The Event Loop, Thread Pool, and Libuv.
* **Built-in Modules:** `fs` (File System), `path`, `http`, `events`, and `os`.
* **High-Performance:** Streams, Buffers, and Pipe operations.
* **Web Servers:** Building REST APIs using Express.js and Fastify.
* **Security:** JWT Authentication, Bcrypt, and Middleware integration.
* **Databases:** Connecting with MongoDB (Mongoose) and SQL (Sequelize/Prisma).
